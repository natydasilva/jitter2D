#' Jittered 2D points based on Bivariate normal distribution
#'
#' The jitter geom is a convenient shortcut for
#' `geom_point(position = "jittergauss")`. It adds a small amount of random
#' variation to the location of each point using bivarite normal distribution, and is a useful way of handling
#' overplotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets.
