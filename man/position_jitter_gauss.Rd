\usage{
position_jitter_gauss(weight = NULL, seed = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight, }{spread factor.

  If omitted, just include the spread in the data.}

\item{seed}{A random seed to make the jitter reproducible.
Useful if you need to apply the same jitter twice, e.g., for a point and
a corresponding label.
The random seed is reset after jittering.
If `NA` (the default value), the seed is initialised with a random value;
this makes sure that two subsequent calls start with a different seed.
Use `NULL` to use the current random seed and also avoid resetting
(the behaviour of \pkg{ggplot} 2.2.1 and earlier).}
